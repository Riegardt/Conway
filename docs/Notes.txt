For the purpose of this implementation, cells on the edges consider space beyond the board as
“always dead” cells. For example, board size 3 will generate a 5x5 grid that contains a
border and 3x3 content of random cells.

In order to conserve computational power and memory, I took the “egocentric approach”
together with the strategy of “one array plus two line buffers”, as mentioned on the
Wikipedia page.

- If you specify no size, the program will exit.
- If you specify no generation count, it will continue until keypress.

I was having fun with this and I wanted to demonstrate extendability and some abstraction,
while still maintaining the simplicity of the original project. So there is some extra code
in the "Advanced Source" folder - the only reference to it from the main solution is one line
in Program.cs

All it does is include some preset patterns instead of random cells. To call them, set
the UseAdvanced constant in Program.cs to "true". You can then load the presets when
you specify board sizes -1, -2, -3 and -4.
